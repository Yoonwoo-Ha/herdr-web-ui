# Changelog

herdr web ui is versioned with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is a
`vX.Y.Z` Git tag with a GitHub release. Installs update only to releases; commits on `main`
between releases do not reach them. Remote-PC runtime bundles are versioned separately as
`remote-vN` releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- On a phone or tablet, an agent pane opens in the chat the first time you select it; shells, and
  every pane on a desktop, still open their terminal. The lens you pick is still remembered per
  pane.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Remote PC bridges update in the background. When an app update needs a newer bridge, PCs that
  connect with their saved key are updated automatically (**Settings → Remote PCs**, on by
  default); with it off, **Update bridge** starts the same update in one tap. A PC that needs a
  password asks through **Sign in and update…**.
- The sidebar and the header show a bridge update's step, bytes and time left, with **Cancel
  update**. Closing the dialog after approval no longer cancels an install.
- The web server keeps downloaded bridge bundles by checksum and downloads each once, so a second
  PC or a retry only sends it to the PC.

### Fixed
- Dragging the terminal on a phone scrolls herdr's history again. The gesture was lost after its
  first move, since the redraw replaced the row it started on, and the browser then scrolled the
  page or the composer instead. The text now also follows the finger (drag down for older lines),
  and each scroll lands at the finger's position.
- Android notifications show the herdr mark instead of Chrome's bell as their small icon.

### Development
- Tests and the browser QA scripts run in a herdr session of their own, `herdr-web-ui-test`, so
  their workspaces and agents never show in the herdr you work in. `HERDR_TEST_LIVE=1` restores
  the old behaviour.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- A pane opens its terminal the first time you select it, agent panes included, instead of the chat.
  Switch to Chat once and that pane keeps opening in chat.
- `bun run start` now listens on `127.0.0.1` by default, like the plugin, instead of every
  interface. To reach it from your LAN again, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` together with `HERDR_WEB_TOKEN`;
  for a phone, `tailscale serve` or an SSH tunnel to `127.0.0.1` needs no change.
- The README and INSTALL.md say when a token is needed: not on this computer, over an SSH tunnel,
  or through `tailscale serve` on a tailnet of your own devices; needed on a LAN, a shared tailnet
  or a public address.

### Fixed
- A composer message that waited more than 45s behind earlier input is not typed any more; the
  composer keeps it and says nothing was typed. Before, it could reach the pane after the composer
  had given up on it, so sending it again typed it twice.
- Text typed after a message that is still sending keeps its leading spaces, and an edit inside
  the part being sent stays in the box with a note that it was not sent.
- A numbered menu row under Codex's collapsed question queue is no longer mistaken for its main
  prompt.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- Remote PCs use the `remote-v2` runtime, which carries 0.3.0's server changes (chat pages, the
  Codex conversation fixes, server-side message sending and `304` answers) to the remote side.
  A PC connected with the `remote-v1` bridge needs **Update bridge…** once; its herdr sessions are
  kept.
- A PC that only an update or an approval can reconnect says so: it stops retrying, shows the next
  step under its name with the button that does it (**Update bridge…** or **Set up…**), and a line
  under the header says the same, so it shows on a phone with the drawer closed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Chat history pages: a transcript is read one page at a time (at most 16MB and 50 prompts), and
  scrolling up loads earlier turns while keeping your place. A long Codex rollout no longer re-reads
  the whole file on every poll, and a Codex conversation that was backtracked shows the history
  from the rollouts before it.
- **Settings → Chat → Chat font size**, from 11 to 24px. Messages, code and prompt cards scale
  together; the rest of the UI and the composer keep their size.
- The composer is resizable: drag its top edge or use ↑/↓, double-tap or press Home to go back to
  the automatic height. The height is remembered per device and capped at half the visible screen.
- The status line shows the reasoning effort Claude Code records, for example `Reasoning xhigh`.

### Changed
- **New session** is back at the top of the sidebar, opening on the selected PC (the same as
  Mod+Shift+N), with **Add PC** beside it.
- **Install app** shows in the sidebar unless the app is installed. Where the browser offers no
  install prompt (iOS, plain HTTP), it explains the platform's own steps, such as Share → Add to
  Home Screen on iOS. Settings → Install shows the same steps.
- A composer message is now sent on the server: agent panes use herdr's `agent.prompt`, which pastes
  the text and presses Enter separately, and refuses while the agent waits for an answer. Other
  panes get the text, a short gap, then Enter. This fixes messages left unsent in the agent's input
  box on phones, where the text and its Enter used to arrive as one chunk. The composer keeps the
  text until the pane confirms it, and says why when it can't be sent.
- The empty composer is taller (42px on desktop, 48px on touch) and its status line is a size up.
- Unchanged conversations answer `304` with no body, and the chat stops polling while the page is
  hidden, which saves data and battery on phones.
- Each window reopens its own pane on reload; a new window still starts on the last pane used.

### Fixed
- A Codex pane kept its conversation only while an answer was on screen; a long run of tool output
  flipped the chat to "Conversation unavailable". The pane now keeps the rollout it matched, or the
  thread named by `codex resume`, until a newer interactive thread begins in that directory.
- Conversation cursors are tied to the Codex rollout chain, so a changed chain reloads the chat
  instead of showing turns twice or out of order, and a chain whose earlier rollout was archived is
  looked up again instead of falling back to terminal output.
- On an iPhone, a second tap on the token field no longer closes the keyboard, and the empty band
  under the composer is gone.
- On Windows, the terminal measures its cells with a monospace font, so ASCII text is no longer
  spaced apart.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- Updates now replace the update supervisor too. `server/managed.ts` became a small launcher that
  runs the active release's supervisor; after an install passes its health check the supervisor
  hands over to the new one (one more brief reconnect), and a new supervisor that cannot start is
  replaced by the previous one, with the failure shown in Settings → Updates.
- Release CI skips the one updater test that needs a live herdr.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Remote PCs over SSH: **Add PC** walks through the host fingerprint, password or key passphrase and
  an approved install, then groups workspaces by PC. Chat, files, images, terminal input and alerts
  follow the selected PC.
- Remote runtime bundles for linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64 and darwin-arm64, published as the
  `remote-v1` release and verified by SHA-256.
- Managed app updates: `bun run start` and the herdr plugin run a supervisor that builds each update
  in a private checkout, restarts after a health check, and rolls back a failed start.
- Updates follow release tags, and **Settings → Updates** and the header notice show versions
  (`v0.2.0`) instead of commit ids. The sidebar footer shows the running version.
- herdr plugin installs, which herdr leaves as a shallow detached checkout, can now update in place.
- [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), a step-by-step install guide written for coding agents.

### Changed
- Warm terminal redesign: amber on graphite (dark) and ledger paper (light), with agent states in
  their own colors. Sidebar titles use the full width, PC headers fit on one line, user chat turns
  are neutral cards, and the composer placeholder is short.
- The header drops the version pill and the theme toggle. The version is in the connection chip's
  tooltip and the sidebar footer, and theme lives in Settings and the command palette.
- README rewritten around setup, remote PCs, mobile use and updates.

### Fixed
- Codex transcripts resolve on macOS, where `/proc` does not exist.
- Underscores inside identifiers (`MAC_QA_CHAT_OK`) stay literal in rendered Markdown.
- The settings shortcut table no longer splits its row rules.
